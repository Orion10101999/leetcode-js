# About the Course

- An Introduction to the fundamentals of algorithms

- A practical take on algorithms with JavaScript

- Part one of a two part (Algoritms + Data Structures) Course

- (Algorithms on trees and graphs will part of the next course)

## Course Topics 

- Algorithms 

- Measuring performance 

- Time & Space complexity

- Big O notation

- Math algorithms

- Sort

- Search

- Misc. algorithms and problem solving

## Prerequisites :-

- Modern Javascript

    * JavaScript fundamentals crash course
    * Advanced JavaScript crash course
    * ES2015 topics

## Before we begin :-

- It might seem hard and that is because it is hard

- Have a pen and paper and trace the excution of code with a sample input .

- Code along with me and do not rush through the videos .

## Q.1. What is an Algorithm ?

- An algorithm is a set of well - defined instructions to solve a particular problem 


### Recipe Analogy :-

- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instrictions to solve a particular problem .

- Ingredients --> Recipe --> Tasty dish

- Cup of noodles Taste maker water --->

1. Boil Water
2. Pour water into cup
3. Add taste maker 
4. Close lid and wait 4 minutes 

- ---> Tasty noodles 

## Programming :-

- Algorithm to add two numbers 

- Inputs --> Algorithm --> Output

- Two numbers 'a' and 'b' --> 

1. Add numbers using '+'
2. Return the value

- --> Sum of 'a' and 'b'

* An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem .

## Characteristics :-

- Well defined inputs and outputs 

- Each step should be clear and unambiguous .

- Language independent 

- Two numbers 'a' and 'b' -->

1. Add numbers using '+'
2. Return the value

--> Sum of 'a' and 'b'

## Why Algorithms ?

- As a devloper , you're going to come across problems that you need to solve

- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems .

- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

- Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance .
