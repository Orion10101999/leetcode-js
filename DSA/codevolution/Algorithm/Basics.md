# About the Course

- An Introduction to the fundamentals of algorithms

- A practical take on algorithms with JavaScript

- Part one of a two part (Algoritms + Data Structures) Course

- (Algorithms on trees and graphs will part of the next course)

## Course Topics 

- Algorithms 

- Measuring performance 

- Time & Space complexity

- Big O notation

- Math algorithms

- Sort

- Search

- Misc. algorithms and problem solving

## Prerequisites :-

- Modern Javascript

    * JavaScript fundamentals crash course
    * Advanced JavaScript crash course
    * ES2015 topics

## Before we begin :-

- It might seem hard and that is because it is hard

- Have a pen and paper and trace the excution of code with a sample input .

- Code along with me and do not rush through the videos .

## Q.1. What is an Algorithm ?

- An algorithm is a set of well - defined instructions to solve a particular problem 


### Recipe Analogy :-

- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instrictions to solve a particular problem .

- Ingredients --> Recipe --> Tasty dish

- Cup of noodles Taste maker water --->

1. Boil Water
2. Pour water into cup
3. Add taste maker 
4. Close lid and wait 4 minutes 

- ---> Tasty noodles 

## Programming :-

- Algorithm to add two numbers 

- Inputs --> Algorithm --> Output

- Two numbers 'a' and 'b' --> 

1. Add numbers using '+'
2. Return the value

- --> Sum of 'a' and 'b'

* An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem .

## Characteristics :-

- Well defined inputs and outputs 

- Each step should be clear and unambiguous .

- Language independent 

- Two numbers 'a' and 'b' -->

1. Add numbers using '+'
2. Return the value

--> Sum of 'a' and 'b'

## Why Algorithms ?

- As a devloper , you're going to come across problems that you need to solve

- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems .

- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

- Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance .

## Algorithm analysis :-

- There are multiple ways to solve one problem 

- Ex: There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers .

- How do we analyse which one of them is the most efficient algorithm ?

- Generally , when we talk about performance , we use an absolute measure 

- If I can run 100 meters in 12 seconds , I,m faster than someone who takes 15 seconds .

## Algorithm analysis contd .

- The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted , since it depends on a number of factors 

- Programming language used to implement the algorithm 

- The computer the program runs on 

- others programs running at the same time 

- Quality of the operating system 

- We evalute the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size 

* Time Complexity :- Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run , as a function of input size 

* Space Complexity :- amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run , as a function of input size .

- By evaluating against the input size , the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparision is also more appropriate .

- There is no one solution that works every single time . It is always good to known multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution  , given your constraints . 

- If your app needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with , you don't have to worry about space complexity .

- If you have very little memory to work with , you should pick a solution that is relatively slower but needs less space

## How to represent complezity ?

- Asymptotic notations 

- Mathmatical tools to represent time and space complexity .

1. Big - O Notation (O - notation) - Worst case complexity 

2. Omega Notation (omega - notation) - Best Case Complexity

3. Theta Notation (theta - notation) - Avarage Case Complexity
