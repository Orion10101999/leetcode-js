        Today is Sunday so i have some free time to talk to all the member of this group .i am going to share some thoughts and concerns regarding our village,Gram panchayat,block and district.

Today I am here to highlight some thoughts on youth, and I am thrilled to share my opinions on the topic of youth empowerment.

Well, to begin with, I would like to reiterate that the future of our village lies in the hands of its youth.
The more we empower our youth today, the brighter tomorrow our village ,panchayat and district will witness.

The first thing that we have to ensure for the development of our village is that the youth of our village  get an opportunity for education. 
Though the right to education is one of the fundamental rights as per our Constitution, yet, even today, the young kids in the rural parts of our country  like in our village Mahadipur wasa or our gram panchayat kurwan or our block Beldaur are deprived of this basic human right. 
This leads to a lack of awareness among them and eventually when they grow up there is a lack of employment opportunities.

Therefore it is as important to educate youths of our village.

One major point that we should be keeping at the forefront is that the methods and subjects of education have to be optimized as per the need of the hour.
The youth of our village has to be provided with basic education at a minimum of costs 
For this we need good schools,Coaching centre.

I believe, apart from primary education, it is important to educate the youth on sociopolitical state affairs. In this way, they can make the best call when it comes to choosing a career that will ensure their individual development as well as the collective development of our district khagaria.

Since the youth of our village are our torchbearers, it is really important that they are directed on the right path. They should be well informed of the current affairs and the crises that our village is going through.

They should be well aware of the struggles what we as a young population of  our  village is facing now.
In our village there is no good basic facilities,no infrastructure development,Not a good primary health care facility and not even a good standard school.

On a lighter note i want to say to all of you should be able to understand the sense of compassion and brotherhood,well read of the Constitution, their rights, and duties and should lead by example.
All the education you receive will empower you and make  you more confident to face adversities bravely and to take every situation in  your stride.

This is the first time i am interacting with all of you .
I only want to say 
"Belief in yourself’’ 
Next Sunday will meet again if any students of this group want help from me regarding study can interact.
